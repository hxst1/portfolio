      <p class="text-white mb-2">
        Since my teenage years, I've been deeply fascinated with computer science and cybersecurity. My journey began at 16, leading me to a specialization in programming where I focus on crafting innovative solutions.

      <p class="text-white mb-10">
        My toolkit includes technologies like Next.js, TypeScript, Ruby on Rails, Node.js, and MongoDB. I pride myself on writing clean, scalable code. Over 1,000 hours of programming have fueled my professional and personal growth, continually driving me to learn and explore new technologies.
